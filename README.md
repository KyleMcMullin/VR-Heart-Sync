## Introduction

Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to provide immersive experiences, but it can be even more captivating when it responds to the user's physiological state. VR Heart Sync is designed to achieve just that by monitoring the user's heart rate and adapting the VR environment accordingly.

## Features

- Real-time heart rate monitoring using compatible wearable devices
- Dynamic selection technique (FOCUS) that adapts precision based on user fatigue levels
- Integration with popular VR headsets, including Meta Quest 2
- Customizable VR environments for fitness, gaming, mental health experiences, and emergency training

## Getting Started

To get started with VR Heart Sync, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine
2. Install Unity 2021.3.17f1
3. Connect a Meta Quest 2 to your instance of Unity
4. Connect a compatible heart rate monitoring device and configure it to work with the application
5. Build and run the VR Heart Sync application on your VR headset or development environment

## Usage

Once the application is up and running, you can use VR Heart Sync to explore its features and adapt the VR environment based on your heart rate. Use the FOCUS technique to improve your interaction with the virtual world, and experiment with different scenarios tailored to fitness, gaming, mental health, or emergency training.
